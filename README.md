This is my first real repositoy, and the project I'm uploading here was the first big thing I worked on when I was learning python

This is Pytris, a tetris clone with a hold feature, the real super rotation system, hard drops, pausing, and three separate modes!
This has been a few years in the making, largely because I didn't have the proper time nor equipment for most of my time making it, but it is close to being as good as it could be, at least as far as I'm concerned.
